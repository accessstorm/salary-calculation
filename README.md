## Key Features Explained

### Salary Calculation Logic
```
Per Day Salary = Base Salary √∑ 30
Net Days Worked = Total Days + (Half Days √ó 0.5)
Gross Salary = (Base Salary √∑ 30) √ó Net Days Worked
Half Day Deduction = (Per Day Salary √∑ 2) √ó Half Days
Unpaid Leave Deduction = Per Day Salary √ó Leave Days
Net Payable = Gross Salary - Half Day Deduction - Unpaid Leave Deduction + Efficiency Adjustment + Overtime Pay + Bonus
```

- Filter payroll records by month, year, status
- Bulk operations for multiple employees
- Export data in CSV format
